## Course Description

This course is a graduate-level introduction to the probabilistic methods, a fundamental and powerful technique in combinatorics and theoretical computer science. The essence of the approach is to show that some combinatorial object exists and prove that a certain random construction works with positive probability. The course focuses on methodology as well as combinatorial applications.

## Topics

- Linearity of expectations
- Alterations
- Second moment
- Chernoff bound
- Lovász local lemma
- Correlation inequalities
- Janson inequalities
- Concentration of measure
- Entropy
- Containers

## Textbook

Alon, Noga and Joel H. Spencer. *The Probabilistic Method*. Wiley, 2016. ISBN: 9781119061953. (The fourth edition is the latest, but earlier editions suffice.)

## Grading

Grading is primarily based on homework grades (no exams). A modifier up to 5 percentage points may be applied (in either direction) in calculating the final grade, based on factors such as participation.

Final letter grade cutoffs: Only non-starred problems are considered for the calculations of letter grades other than A and A+.

- A− : ≥ 85%
- B− : ≥ 70%
- C− : ≥ 50%

Grades of A and A+ are awarded at instructor's discretion based on overall performance. Solving a significant number of starred problems is a requirement for grades of A and A+.

Note that for MIT students, ± grade modifiers do not count towards the GPA and do not appear on the external transcript.
